# CODING CHALLENGE 2
# Part 4: user input (finding your retirement age)


# Ask the user for an input of their current age,
# and tell them how many years until they reach retirement (65 years old).

age = int(input("How old are you? "))
print("You are" + " " + str(age) + " " + "years old!")
print("You have" + " " + str(65 - age) + " " + "years until you are 65 and can retire!")

# AD: Absolutely brilliant.
