## I'm Emily
I am a graduate student in the MESM program focusing on conservation biology and I am also pursuing a certificate in GIS and Remote Sensing. For the past few years I have been working in various positions to restore nesting grounds for Pacific seabirds and to collect data on nesting Atlantic Coast sea/shorebirds.
At this point in my career I have never not worked in a coastal setting.

From my time in the coastal ecology world I have gained:
 - a sense of self / a job and career path that I really, actually love
 - a pretty interesting and extensive collection of marine debris (i.e., weird little toys, glass fishing floats, lighters from interesting places, etc.) ~~I promise it's a cool collection and **not** a gross hobby that I'm openly admitting to...~~
 - a sandal tan that remains visible well into the winter
 - hundreds of thousands of nest camera photos that serve as the basis of my major paper

#### What I've Been Up to at URI...
> Although I'm not in a thesis program, I have been working on a major paper in the interest of understanding monitoring error related to Piping Plover nest fate as well using my > gigantic collection of nest camera photos to look at the relationship between rates of predator visitation to active nests and the likelihood of frequently visited nests to fail. 

>I'm also hoping improve my GIS skills and coding skills ~~which were pretty limited when I started this program, but I'm building confidence...I think/am pretty sure/probably~~.
>Last spring I took a class focusing on manipulating big datasets with differnt coding programs...it was...*intimidating*. I felt (and still feel) most comfortable in R, and am here (in this **_python and GIS course_**) in an attemt to break out of that comfort zone a bit...

#### What I'll Be Up to Later...
If all goes accordingly this semester I will be graduating in May. 

I hope to use my degree to continue working with sensitive wildlife and to provide the best possible life for my cat.
